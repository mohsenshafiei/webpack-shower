#### Reporting Bugs, Enhancements or etc

Before creating bug reports, please check issues list as you might find out that you don't need to create one.
 When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.

 > **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open
  a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.


#### Pull Requests

The team lead is monitoring for pull requests. Your team lead will review your pull request and either merge it,
request changes to it, or close it with an explanation.

*Before submitting a pull request*, please make sure the following is done:

- clone the repository and create your branch from dev branch.
- Run npm install in the repository root.
- If youâ€™ve fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!
- Ensure the test suite passes (npm run test).
- Format your code with prettier (npm run prettier)
- Make sure your code lints (npm run lint).
- Run the TypeScript type checks.
